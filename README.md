# h5forest
HDF5 Forest (`h5forest`) is an interactive CLI application for exploring HDF5 files.

`h5ls` works, and `h5glance` is a great improvement on it. So "Why bother?" I hear you say. 

Well, `h5forest` brings interactivity and functionality not available in its long-standing brethren. `h5forest` includes:

- An interactive interface capable of handling files with deep hierarchies and large numbers of groups.
- Real-time metadata and attribute displays.
- The ability to display the contents of a Dataset.
- The ability to get basic statistics from a Dataset.
- The ability to quickly plot datasets against each other.

The following features will be coming soon:
- A search function.
- Renaming of Datasets and Groups.
